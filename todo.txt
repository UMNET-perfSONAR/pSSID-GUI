TODO STUFF

- error handling i think rn because the forms are pass by reference if it errors itll still change on frontend

bad idea because what if the directory/files change // init from session token

done // make all the loading stuff in the app component and then v-model all the subsets (nodes, schedules, etc)

- the flexbox broke it doesnt scroll anymore sadge

- move the metadata format conversion to python wtf were you thinking
  eh maybe not idk
  but the js stuff is supposed to be modular...
  but then i have to repeat meta for hosts and groups...
  actually i dont if it all goes through to submit
  def do this

done // delete is broken for schedules prob has something to do with it not having id's
  go to the session, delete by id then dump the session into the yml file
  also use the session for the other stuff wtf

- smart channel picker processing with ranges

done but at what cost // refresh button doesnt work

done // change node init to read from hosts.ini

- auto import all input modules

done basically // make extradata not super dumb

done // block changing all name / deleting all group

- extra newlines in hosts.ini

done // reset button doesnt work

in the group folder where else would they go // hold up where tf is group meta supposed to go

done ez clap // 6/25 FINISH SSID PROFILES AND GROUPS USE THE NEW GENERALIZED NODE PICKER COMPONENT

- child components in json fields?

- some sort of cross verifier so that hosts.ini and and the directories are synced

- theres more than one authmethod

done // status dot ugly

ehhhh i dont really need to // generalize backend submit functions

decided against // ~~not using ids for groups slow maybe??~~ just give up and use the names its too complicated

- github stuff

done lets goooo // multiple file systems select in main

done // labels in form

done shh nobody will know // change the watcher in vueEditor to be computed

done // replace showMetadata with if meta in slot names

NOTES
initvalue checks if the __slot name__ from json is the same as whats received from the node list / django server
the title prop is for the output
